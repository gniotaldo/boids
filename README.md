# Description
OpenGL simulation of flocking behavior (Boids algorithm) demonstrating separation, alignment, and cohesion rules in a virtual aquarium.

# Features
* Boids algorithm
* Procedurally generated terrain and obstacles (cacti and algae)
* AABB-based collision detection system
* Normal mapping
* Shadow mapping

# Controls
WSAD – camera movement  
T G Y H U J I K – adjust algorithm weights  
Z – toggle shadow mapping
